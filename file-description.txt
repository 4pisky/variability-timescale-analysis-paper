Individual class directories contain radio light-curves collected from the literature. The column headings in the files are as follows:
col. 1 - Time (days)
col. 2 - Flux density (Jy)
col. 3 - Flux density error (Jy)


Additionally, within some of the individual class directories, the 'GBI' directories contain light-curves downloaded from the GBI database and have the following column headings:

col. 1 - Mod. Julian Date of observation (JD-2400000.5).
col. 2 - Local Hour Angle of observation (hours).
col. 3 - Flux Density in Janskys at  2.25 GHz
col. 4 - Flux Density in Janskys at  8.3 GHz.
col. 5 - Spectral index.
col. 6 - Estimated 1-sigma error of col. 3.
col. 7 - Estimated 1-sigma error of col. 4.
